If I had more time, I would have really liked to:

1. I was trying to figure out how I could implement sorting of the data better. One idea I had was to include a small SVG arrow next to the column name, and clicking it would toggle from sorting ascending, to descending, to no sort on that field.

2. I like how the infinite scroll works, but now that it's implemented, I think I would have worked to only allow scrolling within the window of the results and not allow the scrollbar on the entire height of the window.

3. I would like to implement a dark mode

4. I would also like to make the layout a bit more responsive for mobile devices
